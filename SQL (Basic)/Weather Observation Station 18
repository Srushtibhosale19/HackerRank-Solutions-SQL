Consider p1(a,b) and p2(c,d)  to be two points on a 2D plane.
a. happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
b. happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
c. happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
d. happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of  decimal places.

Input Format
The STATION table is described as follows:
        STATION
+-------------+--------------+
| Field       | Type         |
+-------------+--------------+
| ID          | NUMBER       |
| CITY        | VARCHAR2(21) |
| STATE       | VARCHAR2(2)  |
| LAT_N       | NUMBER       |
| LONG_W      | NUMBER       |
+-------------+---------------+
where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

Solution:
select round(abs(min(LAT_N)-max(LAT_N))+abs(min(LONG_W)-max(LONG_W)),4)
from station;
